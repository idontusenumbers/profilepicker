# profilepicker

A jQuery widget to quickly and easily upload or capture a profile picture

## Features
* Automatically locates face and crops upon upload or live when capturing from webcam
* Uses off-screen buffer when capturing so face detection and preview are high speed (using low resolution) and actually captures full-resolution
* Supports manual re-crop

## Controls
After capture, pan with drag-drop, zoom with mouse wheel

# Limitations
* Repeatedly asks for permission when served from local file system instead of web server
* Not tested for accessibility
